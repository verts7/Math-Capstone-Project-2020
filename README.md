 This was my capstone project for my applied mathematics track for my Bachelors in Mathematics. This was done my sophomore year as I had already completed all prerequisite classes to take optimization courses.
 This is not my best work, but it is an example of an analysis constructed from ideas in pure mathematics that can applied to solve relevant business problem statements. 
 The problem statement constructed is an Integer program which is discrete so it's feasible solution is not convex.
